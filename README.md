# READ ME
---

The purpose of this repo is to store utilities that I have written and want to keep track of for the future.

## commit.sh
---
This commit utility is used for conventional commits from the command line.

## go-proj.sh
---
This is a utility to create a new Go project with a standard structure. It initializes a Go module, creates directories for source code and tests, and sets up a README file.
